<h1>Homework 2: Khoshick Ganesh</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>I have a proposal to find the right cutting tool for turning process considering various parameters such as the machining speed, feed, depth of cut, Tool shape, Tool coating, Tool cost etc. as per the requirement of the process. We can collect the tool data from the major pioneers in the cutting tool industry like Sandvik, Kennametal, etc. Each company has individual interface to find the tool, but there is no combined interface. We can create a separate interface using the six steps of Mechanistic data science.&nbsp;</p>
